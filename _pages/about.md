Thank you for stopping by.

# About Me

I am an amateur (and shall always be one) in all the things I define myself through- a researcher, an engineer, a poet. The only skill I truly try to master is that of studying and learning.

For my professional journey, works and achievments look around this site, all of them are engrained somewhere or the other.

I hope visitng my minimal portfolio page would have lightened your day a bit. If so, don't forget to let me know by leaving a message on one of those pages mentioned on the left.
